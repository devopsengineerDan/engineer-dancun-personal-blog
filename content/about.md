I am a software engineer. I major in the fields of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. I provide Security Intelligence services for companies and multi-agencies. My expertise help strengthen their security posture by conducting security vulnerability assessments, audits, providing security best practices in the entire system infrastructure and source code. 

When there’s spare time I pursue fitness goals, ride bicycles, swim, write code (for fun!), play pool and chess. I find inspiration through hikes and driving. 

Here are some of the technologies I work with:

  * HTML, CSS, Pyscript
  * Python
  * MicroPython
  * C
